This activity demonstrates the functionality of Varanus as follows.

The app is a simple game where you feed a monitor lizard three different types of food, of different
sizes.  This "food" actually sends network requests of different sizes. No more than every 10
seconds, the monitor lizard "wakes up" and "eats" the food, thus logging how much has been eaten
and displaying it to the user.  The amount of food eaten persists.
